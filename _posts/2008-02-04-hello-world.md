Well I thought it was time to start a technical blog, I';d like
somewhere to put my ideas out there for open criticism, too often we
voice our opinions in an echo chamber with people who you already know
agree with your way of thinking or people who don't understand the
concepts you're discussing and as such just agree with you.

Currently I';m doing a lot of reading and playing around with [Domain Driven Design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/)
and how I can make better use of it in my systems. I'm in the process
of building an e-commerce system that integrates an out of the box
content management system ([Sitefinity](http://www.sitefinity.com)
by Telerik). The big technical goals for the project are increasing
automated testability and reducing the codebase size by better use of
out of the box solutions such as NHibernate & Castle Windsor.

At home I'm working with applying some of the things from .Net 3.5 to DDD,
including LINQ to SQL and ASP.NET MVC (so many acronyms...) and hope to
have some stuff up here for it soon.
