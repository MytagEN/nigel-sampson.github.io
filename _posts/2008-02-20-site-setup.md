I&#39;m currently going through migrating the site from being a Google blog
to a fully hosted site with CMS etc. There have been some highs and
lows in this and I&#39;ll go through them all later just it case anyone
else gets the same problems.

I&#39;m still tinkering with the design
and final issues with what I want pages. I also want to put some some
full code samples from what I&#39;ve already posted.
