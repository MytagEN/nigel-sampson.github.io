I&#39;ve started playing with Resharper 4.0 and one of the first things I
noticed was that it recommends using var for local variables, there&#39;s a
great post at &quot;[Varification -- Using Implicitly Typed Locals](http://resharper.blogspot.com/2008/03/varification-using-implicitly-typed.html)&quot;
about their perspective on it. It&#39;s interesting reading and given me a
lot to think about. The second note that it &quot;induces&quot; better named
variables is interesting, it instantly remind me of the debate about
TypeMock, and how that other mocking frameworks &quot;induce&quot; better designs.
