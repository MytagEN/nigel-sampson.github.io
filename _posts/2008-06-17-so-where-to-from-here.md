Originally when I wrote the previous post I was all fired up to start
an MVC CMS as way to get myself update to data with some new things,
namely the new MVC framework, JQuery and Silverlight. However the more
I thought about it the more I realised the standard view factory
doesn&#39;t lend itself well completely customisable pages, one of the
great things about MVC is that we could switch out the view engine for
something that could work. However I feel this defeats a lot of the
purpose of the exercise. 

So currently my brain is churning
around ideas for applications for this technology that may even become
products in their own right (my company is really good in this regard).
So far possiblities include...

* A online CCG style game.
* Client portal to ALM systems such as TFS and SourceGearFortress.
* Online reservation system for small to medium accomodation providers.
* and whatever else my brain comes up with...

Interestingly
most discussion around product ideas says ideas are the easy part it&#39;s
implementing it that are difficult. Either my imagination is terrible
or the criteria I&#39;m judging them by is overly harsh.
