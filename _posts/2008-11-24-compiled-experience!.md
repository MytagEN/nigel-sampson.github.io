As you can see I&#39;ve moved things to a new blog, with a new name, design
and software. For me things like this are fresh starts which help to
develop new habits, the excitement of something new means new habits
start and with effort I can keep them going.

So what is Compiled Experience? (thanks to [Barry](http://genericerror.com/)
for the name), It&#39;s a new place for me blog, mostly around Silverlight
and Dynamic Data, to share what I&#39;ve learned and talk about those damn
bugs that never have an answer anywhere else on the web.

I&#39;m
especially looking forward to doing some work around Silverlight and
WPF Line of Business Applications and providing UI scaffoling
capabilities.
