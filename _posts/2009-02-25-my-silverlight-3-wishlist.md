With MIX coming up I&#39;d thought I&#39;d list some of the things I&#39;m wanting to see in Silverlight 3. 

* Support for WCF Streaming
* WPF Binding Expressions such as ElementName
* Less internal capabilities such as TypeProxy which enables the capabilities of Style.TargetType (It would have been useful for &quot;Creating a dependency property of type System.Type&quot;) or the x:Type syntax from WPF
* Image manipulation (System.Drawing)
* SaveFileDialog

&nbsp;The line of business capabilities certainly look interesting as well, my biggest concerns with them is their extensiblity. I&#39;ve done a lot of work lately with ASP.NET Dynamic Data and some with the MVC framework and have been thoroughly impressed with the different ways they can be customised in very logical ways. This contrasts a lot with some of the other work I&#39;ve done with Linq to SQL and other areas of ASP.NET, if my coworkers had a dollar for every time I swore about the interal or sealed keywords they&#39;d all have retired rich.

I&#39;m away for a bit but I&#39;ve got a new series of post ideas lined up which I&#39;ll start when I get back.
