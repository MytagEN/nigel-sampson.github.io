title: Combo box data binding in Silverlight 3
tags: silverlight
---


A month or two ago I wrote about a bug in Silverlight 2 regarding to ComboBox and changing the ItemSource ([Gotcha when databinding a ComboBox in Silverlight](/blog/posts/gotcha-when-databinding-a-comboBox-in-silverlight)). 

I&#39;m pleased to say that I couldn&#39;t recreate this error in Silverlight 3.
