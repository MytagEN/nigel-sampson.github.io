title: Dynamic languages in the browser

The MIX Online team released a new framework today, [Gestalt](http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/)
is a javascript library that takes advantage of JQuery, Silverlight and
the Dynamic Language Runtime. Being able to use Ruby or Python as well
as Xaml in a kind of Silverlight Lite is interesting.

While it doesn&#39;t bring any startling new features to the browser it
certainly shows a novel use how these technologies interact and the
capabilities of them all. I think as a prototyping tool or for simple
Silverlight applications it could be really fun. I&#39;m looking forward to
playing with it.

You can download Gestalt from the [MIX Online](http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/) website.
