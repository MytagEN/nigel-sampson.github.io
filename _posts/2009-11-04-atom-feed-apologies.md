It was brought to my attention a few days ago that the atom feed for my posts was behaving terribly in Google Reader. I hadn't correctly set the LastUpdated values for the SyndicationItems nor the Id property, this caused Google reader to bring in the items multiple times. Big apologies for that. Thanks for Steve for assisting with the solution.
