I've had a few emails from people wanting to see some of the concepts here made into a simple MVVM framework. To be honest I don't believe it's worth it. Most of ideas here are prevalent in other MVVM frameworks and they've all done a fantastic pulling them together in a cohesive manner.&nbsp; Some one's I've been looking at for use in a WPF project are:

* [Caliburn](http://www.codeplex.com/caliburn): This library is very rich and features, it's probably the most "different" from the others. Of particular interest is the "Convention over Configuration" for binding the View to the ViewModel. I'm looking at possibly integrating this with Prism (for modularity and view composition).</p>

* [MVVM Light](http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvm/getstarted/): A the name says, a lighter library, very much a long the lines of the Blendable MVVM series I wrote about here. It was excellent additions like event aggregation and templates to make your life a lot easier. Highly reccomend.
