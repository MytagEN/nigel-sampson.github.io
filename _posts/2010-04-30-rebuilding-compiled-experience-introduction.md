title: Rebuilding Compiled Experience&#58; Introduction
tags: mvc csharp
---

It's been a long time since my last post and for that I apologise, my work and personal lives got the better of me. I find I'm a more regular post when I have a series of posts in mind and a clear direction for my writing so I'll be trying to do more of that.

Over the last few months there's been a huge amount of technology released from Microsoft, new versions of [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) and the [.NET Framework](.NET Framework" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/), [Windows Phone](http://developer.windowsphone.com/). I'd like to start to work with some of this and document my experiences. As Rob Conery says "[Be a Good Jedi: Build Your Own Blog](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/be-a-good-jedi-build-your-own-blog/)", technically already done, but a rebuild with new technology is a great way to learn better (or possibly worse) ways of doing things.

So [Compiled Experience](/) will be rebuilt initially with ASP.NET MVC 2 and Entity Framework (the current version is NHibernate), I'll hopefully be able to integrate some Silverlight into it somewhere as well. I want to try out [ELMAH](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/) and also have been using the [.LESS CSS](http://dotlesscss.com/) recently so I'll be using that. This is just the initial technology list I'm sure it may change as things progress and I don't want to limit myself too much yet.

Beyond technologies I really want to push myself to some TDD, without some discipline I find myself in a "Test Later" mindset so trying to get those tests written first will be a challenge. The other challenge will be to ensure any bugs I come across are first verified with a failing test rather than just jumping into the code and trying to fix the issue.

If you've got any questions, comments or suggestions then please let me know.
