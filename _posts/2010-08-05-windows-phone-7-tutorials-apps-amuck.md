I always do a lot better with learning new technologies when there's a clear goal in mind, some small application that uses the functionality I want to learn. The [AppsAmuck](http://appsamuck.com/) website currently provides 31 of these example applications for people wanting to learn iPhone development, what better way to learn some Windows Phone 7 (and Silverlight) than by working my way through bringing these applications across to WP7.

I' have the first two applications, Minutes to Midnight and Candle already up at [Windows Phone 7 Tutorials](/windows-phone).
