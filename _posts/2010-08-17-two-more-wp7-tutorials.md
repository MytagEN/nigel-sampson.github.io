title: Two more WP7 tutorials

I've just upated the [Windows Phone 7 Example Applications](/windows-phone) list with the next two applications. Both are a little longer, and little more complex as I try to introduce some more features. Given that both also use Expression Blend to do some of the work I've included videos on how to use Blend.

[Count Me In](/windows-phone/tutorials/count-me-in) is an app to help you keep your place while counting, it introduces the **MVVM pattern**, commands, binding and behaviors.

[Reaction Time](/windows-phone/tutorials/reaction-time) tests your reaction speed and brings into play the Silverlight **Visual State Manager**, transforms and transitions.

Hope you enjoy.
