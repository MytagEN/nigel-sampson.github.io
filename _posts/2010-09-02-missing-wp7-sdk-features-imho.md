title: Missing WP7 SDK features IMHO

Windows Phone 7 is very close to release which I'm really looking forward to, what I'm really hoping is that version iterations for the phone are quick and we can see a lot more features showing up. Here's a few things I'd like to see in the pipeline based on my experience so far in developing on the device.

 - **Version parity with Silverlight 4**: Having the differences in Silverlight between the web and the phone make things a little more complicated, especially when Silverlight 4 solved a lot of my problems around Binding (especially to behaviors). Having a Content Loader available for PhoneApplicationFrame would also enable better MVVM patterns as well.
 - **Launchers and Choosers**: There needs to be some more of these available, launching the maps application at a certain point would be great. A chooser capable of selecting a profile and not just a number or email address would be very useful for prepopulating forms in CRM style apps. 
 - **Emulator**: A more persistent emulator with regards to things like Isolated Storage, settings and contacts would make any application working with these easier.

For me the more important things are clearly extensiblity in the platform and the phone itself. I hope this is where we're heading.
