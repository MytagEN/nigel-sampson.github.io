title: Windows Phone 7 Tutorials&#58; Isolated Storage and User Controls
tags: csharp windows-phone

The next two tutorials in the [Windows Phone 7 Sample Applications](/windows-phone) have just been uploaded. They've taken a little longer to get out as I've started work on my first actual application for the Windows Phone 7, a client for the Stack Overflow family of websites. I'm also developing the example applications out of series because I'm waiting for the offical maps controls before developing applications using that.

[Quick Mail](/windows-phone/tutorials/quick-mail) allows you to store email templates to allow you to send out standard emails quickly. It demonstrates user of **Isolated Storage**, the **Application Bar** and **Page Navigation**.

[Snowfall](/windows-phone/tutorials/snowfall) displays an animated snowfall you can interact with using touch events. It demonstrates **creating User Controls** and **Manipulation Events**.

Hope you enjoy.
