This is an embarrassing admission, but a few days ago this site was compromised. It appears the FTP account was compromised (how I'm still looking into) and was malicious javascript was appended to all .js files.

Thankfully I found out very quick (within hours) and was able to restore the site from source control as well as change passwords.

Apologies to any affected.
