title: Windows Phone 7 Tutorials&#58; Maps, GPS and Accelerometer

I've just uploaded the next three tutorials in the [Windows Phone 7 Tutorials](/windows-phone) series. I ended up doing a batch of three this time due the simplistic nature of any tutorials involving features the emulator doesn't support well such as GPS and the Accelerometer.

[Quake](/windows-phone/tutorials/quake) covers something very close to New Zealand at the moment, earthquakes. In the tutorial we cover retrieving earthquake data, parising it using Linq to Xml and placing quake markers on the new Bing Maps control.

[Where am I?](/windows-phone/tutorials/where-am-i) shows how you can use Reactive Extensions to emulate the GeoCoordinateWatcher class in the phone emulator.

[Hold it Level](/windows-phone/tutorials/level) again uses Reactive Extensions, this time to emulate the Accelerometer, we also use the VibrateController to provide tactile feedback to the user.
