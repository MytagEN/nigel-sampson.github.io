I've had quite a few emails lately about the code sample colouring used on the website and where people can get it. I use a plugin named "Copy Source as Html" for the code samples on the blog so in a very cool way it simply uses my Visual Studio settings.

The style is named [Son of Obsidian](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/son-of-obsidian) and it can be downloaded from the really neat [Studio Styles](http://studiostyl.es/) website.

The blog has been pretty quiet lately as I've been working on two Windows Phone 7 applications, the first for general release on the marketplace and the second for a local competition, so fingers crossed in win.
