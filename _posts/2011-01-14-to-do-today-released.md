title: To Do Today 1.3 Released

I'm proud to announce the in the last few weeks I've released version 1.3 of [To Do Today](m/windows-phone/to-do) for Windows Phone 7. 

This release adds the following features

 - Recurring Tasks - easily deal with tasks you have to do on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.
 - Email task details
 - SMS task details
 - Live tile correctly uses theme colour.

There was an issue with the initial upate where the application was incorrectly categorised as a Game, this has been corrected. One annoying thing about applications updates is that the Marketplace doesn't recall the current version details and the categorisation was missed. My apologies for anyone this affected.

So go download the trial and if you enjoy the app then I'd love some more positive reviews. Version 1.4 should be rolled out sometime in the next few weeks.
