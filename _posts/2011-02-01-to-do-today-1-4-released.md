I'm proud to announce that the 1.4 update for [To Do Today](/windows-phone/to-do) was approved my Microsoft in record time (less than 12 hours), and should be available on yours phones over the next day or so.

This version brings some performance improvements in both loading and saving larger tasks lists. I'll be making a blog post later on this week about some of these.

The major feature for this release is the ability to break your task list down by category and simple color coding for each as well as a host of minor usability improvements.

I encourage everyone to go check it out!
