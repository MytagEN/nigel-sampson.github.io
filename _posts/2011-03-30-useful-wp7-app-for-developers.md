As a developer for Windows Phone 7 one app I've found incredibly useful is **AppTracker** from [Very Software](http://www.verysoftware.co.uk/). It quickly brings together all reviews for an app from the different marketplaces.

It quickly gives me an idea of how new versions of [To Do Today](http://compiledexperience.com/windows-phone-7/to-do) are performing and also when there are new reviews.

I highly recommend you check it out on the [Marketplace](http://redirect.zune.net/External/LaunchZuneProtocol.aspx?pathuri=navigate?phoneAppID=ceb1e261-9909-e011-9264-00237de2db9e)
