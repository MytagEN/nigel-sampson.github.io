title: To Do Today Pricing Experiment Results
tags: windows-phone to-do-today

A few months ago I [released download details](http://compiledexperience.com/blog/posts/a-windows-phone-7-app-the-numbers) for the first three months of sales of [To Do Today](http://compiledexperience.com/windows-phone-7/to-do). Just after that release I moved the price down from $2.99 to $0.99 as an experiment in pricing. Here's the results.

Download numbers weren't changed by a noticeable amount, averaging around 300 downloads a month. The big change was the shift in conversion rate, previously 20% of people who downloaded the trial ended up purchasing the application, with the price drop this number jumped to around 35%.

If you've done the maths in your head you'll realise that while the increase in numbers is great to see it's actually a change that means I'm earning less money. I figured this would be the case, however I was hoping that a lower selling price would increase downloads and sales and push [To Do Today](http://compiledexperience.com/windows-phone-7/to-do) up the rankings in the Marketplace which would in turn trigger more downloads and sales in a magical spiral of upwardsness. Sadly this hasn't seemed to be occurring.

In the coming month I'll be updating [To Do Today](http://compiledexperience.com/windows-phone-7/to-do) to 1.5 to add some customisation features that people have been requesting such as the home screen, and a feature that I've really had to use lately, the ability to postpone tasks. During this release I'll be shifting the price to around $1.99 to see how this impacts downloads and sales.

Also coming out this month will be another app I've been using to keep track of my spending and giving myself a daily allowance. More about this soon.
