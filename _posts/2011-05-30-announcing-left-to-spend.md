After what's felt like an eternity I'd proud to announce my second Windows Phone 7 application [Left to Spend][l2s] passed certification and is now available to download. It's taken a lot longer than I expected mainly due to being very picky around design and usability. Not being a designer means I end up doing a lot more revisions than say with code.

[Left to Spend][l2s] is a small efficient budget / allowance tracking application, I often try to keep myself to a daily / weekly budget but find myself unable to know if I'm sticking to it without carrying cash. Left to Spend lets you specify your budget as an amount, a period of time (daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly) and whether you want unspent amounts to roll into the next day.

There are quite a few budgeting applications already in the Marketplace, so why did I built another? Well to be honest most of the ones I downloaded and trialled weren't particularly good, any applications that don't do a good job of following the Metro UI patterns I tend to throw out pretty quickly. Some were also overly complicated, if I can't open up the application and enter a purchase quickly then what's the point?

On a side note a big thanks to Ben Tan the designer who did the icon for Left to Spend, I love the way it looks when pinned to your home screen. Roll on Mango when I'll update the app to a full live tile!

I'd love for you to go trial [Left to Spend][l2s] and send me your thoughts and feedback.
