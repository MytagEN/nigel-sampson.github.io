 - Support for fast app switching.
 - Customisable live tiles, including a background agent to ensure tiles are kept up to date when the date changes.

 - Set custom reminders for tasks.

[Left to Spend](http://compiledexperience.com/windows-phone-7/left-to-spend) 2.0 adds:

 - A live tile to let you glance and go about how much money you have left to spend all from the home screen. A background agent keeps this up to date even during date changes.
