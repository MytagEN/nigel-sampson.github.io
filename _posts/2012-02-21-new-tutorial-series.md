Today I'm proud to announce the start of a new tutorial series [Building a Marketplace Ready App][1]. The goal of this series is rather than covering the basics about putting together an application, but rather the large amount of work that's required to take a sample style piece of code and getting it into a shape ready for publication. The first tutorial covering [Setup and Product Search][2] has just been posted.

The other goal with series to help me compile a lot of the disparate utilities I've used to create applications and bring them together into a single package, the 0.1 version you can download from [Nuget][3] or browse the code on [Bitbucket][4].

Take a look and read and let me know what you think.
