From next month I'm happy to announce I'll be taking a full time role as a Senior Metro Developer at [Marker Metro][marker], an award winning Metro agency behind apps such as the incredibly popular Alphajax for Windows Phone. With [Ben Gracewood][ben] also joining I'll have the privilege of working with a lot of highly skilled designers and developers on a lot of things I can't talk about yet. So stay tuned to the Marker Metro website and our respective Twitter feeds.

It's going to be a change moving back to full time employment from contract / freelance, not having to worry about invoices or taxes as much. But I'll be continuing with my Windows Phone apps and tutorials and will still be expanding the website into Windows 8 Metro apps and tutorials. More in the coming months!
