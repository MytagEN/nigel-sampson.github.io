I'm finally ready to give you all the first look at the Windows 8 Metro application I've been working on. Hubble is a new way to create and manage issues on your [GitHub][github] repositories. 

I've used Semantic Zoom to provide management overviews so you can easily visualise how work items are distributed either over your team or milestones. For management I've created a unique drag and drop [Kanban][kanban] style board to assign tasks between collaborators, milestones or labels. Here's the first sneak peek:
