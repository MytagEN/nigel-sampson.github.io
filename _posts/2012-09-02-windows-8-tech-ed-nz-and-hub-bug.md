I’ve been incredibly busy lately and it’s all culminating in next week! 

The first is that I’m proud to announce that [Hub Bug][hubble] (formally named Hubble) has been submitted to the Windows 8 Marketplace and should be (baring any problems) available sometime next week. I’ll be publishing some cool videos then.  Here’s a few screenshots to whet the appetite.

Starting next week I’ll be speaking with [Ian Randall][ian] on Monday and Tuesday at some pre conference [workshops][workshop] around Windows 8. There’s still places available and it’s free so come along if you can.

And then the main event, I’ll be speaking with [Ben Gracewood][ben] at [Tech Ed New Zealand][teched] on Building Real Windows 8 Apps with Xaml and C#. It’s a huge honor and the nerves are already going crazy. In fact everyone at Marker Metro is speaking at Tech Ed (it’s certainly one way to get the whole company to a conference). Ben and Ian are delivering a talk on the Absolute Beginners Guide to Windows 8 Apps while [Keith Patton][keith] will be talking about Windows Phone 8.

If you're attending any of these events come have a chat!
