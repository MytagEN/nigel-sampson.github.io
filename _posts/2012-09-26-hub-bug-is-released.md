Today I’m incredibly happy to announce that [Hub Bug][hubbug] (formally Hubble) is now available on the Windows 8 Store! Hub Bug is a new way to create and manage issues in your [GitHub][github] repositories. Features include:

 - A drag and drop kanban board covering labels, users and milestones.
 - Pin specific repositories to your start screen.
 - Create and edit issues including labels, assigned user and milestones.
 - Join the discussion and comment on issues.
 - Search GitHub with the Windows 8 Search Charm.
 - Share issues and repositories with the Windows 8 Share Charm.

[Hub Bug][hubbug] has a free week long trial so I encourage everyone to take a look.

This is only the initial release and I have a lot in mind including:

 - Organization support
 - Markdown support

As well as some surprises I think you’d like.
