Iâ€™m pleased to announce that the next release of [Hub Bug][hb] has been published by Microsoft into the [Windows 8 Store][store]. This release adds the following:

 - Full support for GitHub Organizations, it will list all repositories in organizations you belong to and will check team permissions as to whether you can edit issues or use the Kanban board.
 - Watch and Star repositories directly from the repository view.
 - Quickly create issues using Hub Bug as a Share Target (check out the video of this below).
