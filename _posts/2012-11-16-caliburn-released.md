Today I'm happy to say that [Rob Eisenberg][rob] has released 1.4 of [Caliburn Micro][cm]! This includes full support for WinRT and Windows Phone 8. There's been a lot of work put in by a lot of different people. Here's Rob's [announcement][announcement].

In terms of where to go from here, there's always some issues to work through and I want to add functionality to help with Windows 8 charms and PLM.

Let me know how it goes.
