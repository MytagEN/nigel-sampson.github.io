title: Windows 8 Theme Colours

I'm not a designer and one of the hardest things for me is a good colour scheme for an app, Windows Phone is a little easier in that if you don't have an existing branding theme to work with you can respect the users choice regarding dark or light theme as well as accent colour.

Windows 8 is different, you don't have access to the users choice regarding accent colour. Not a bad thing in my opinion as it lets you push to make your own apps distinctive in a much larger ecosystem. However you're back to coming up with your own colours.

To make things easier I've created a spreadsheet below of the out of the box colour schemes in Windows 8 to use a starting point in your apps.

I usually take one of these colours and use a tool such as [ColorHexa][ch] to find different shades as well as complementary colours.

Hope this helps some budding designers out there.
