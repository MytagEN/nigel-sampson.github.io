Last night I was able to give a talk to the [Auckland Windows Apps Meetup][1] on the voice features included in the new Windows Phone SDK and how you an augment existing apps with the features.

The talk was all demo and I’ve made the source for it available on [Bitbucket][2]. It contains a simple mock app Flights and adds voice commands, text to speech and speech recognition capabilities. You can use the tags to move between different points of the demo to see each feature individually. 

If you’ve any questions feel free to fire them through. I’d also encourage anyone in the Auckland area interested in Windows Phone and Windows 8 application development to come along and check out the [meetup][1].
