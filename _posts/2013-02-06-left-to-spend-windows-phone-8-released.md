I’m pleased to announce the Windows Phone 8 version of [Left to Spend][cx] is available from the [marketplace][store]. As well as providing updated high definition assets and lock screen notifcations it also adds one of the coolest features I’ve been able to work in a while, voice commands!

Here’s a couple of videos showing what you can now do with Left to Spend.

##Checking your balance

The other big announcement is that I’m experimenting with revenue models over my apps so Left to Spend is now free (with ad support).

Download it now from the [Windows Phone Store][store].
