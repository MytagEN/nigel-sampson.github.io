Last year I had the awesome privilege to attend the first [Codemania][codemania] conference here in Auckland. It’s a good thing to see more “run by developers for developers” events here in New Zealand that aren’t strongly affiliated with a specific vendor. I had a great time, learnt a lot and met a lot of people working outside the Microsoft stack I tend to live in.

This year it’s back on April 12th, with some fantastic speakers such as [Paul Betts][paul], [Glenn Block][glenn] and [Brandon Keepers][brandon]. I’d highly recommend this event so [check it out][codemania].

They’re also running a couple of workshops so I’m hoping I may finally be able to pick up Git properly.
