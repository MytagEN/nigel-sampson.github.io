It's been a busy couple of months which means I haven't posted as much as I'd like. Part of which was because I was preparing to speak at Tech Ed New Zealand.

The talk "Charming Windows 8" is a demo heavy session where I go through the four charms of Windows 8, Search, Share, Print and Settings. Show examples of them all in the built in apps and how to build them all into your own applications. I encourage you to check it out.

It's available to view on Channel 9 under [Charming Windows 8][c9], the slides are available to download on [Skydrive][slides] and the source code for the demo is on [GitHub][source]. Enjoy.
