Lately after having some technical trouble with my previous website host as well as some unrelated issues with my DNS provider I've just completed a successful migration to [Azure Websites][azure] for hosting and [DNSimple][dns].

From my experiences so far I'd highly recommend them both with no reservation. 

[azure]: http://windowsazure.com
[dns]: http://dnsimple.com
