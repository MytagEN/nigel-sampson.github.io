title: Interactive Extensions as a PCL

[Interactive Extensions][ix] is a fantastic library from the team that brought us Reactive Extensions, in fact it supports a lot same operations on IEnumerable that Rx brought to IObservable.

The best way to think about it is that it's a library that takes Linq to the next level, there's a nice summary at [Interactive Extensions for LINQ to Objects][infoq].

However while Ix has been available as a Portable Class Library for a while now it didn't include the appropriate flags for WinRT development. But now it does! Checked in last month to the source was an update to allow it to be used in WinRT, it's not yet published to nuget but I'd highly recommend checking it out.
