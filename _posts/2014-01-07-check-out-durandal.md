title: Check out and back Durandal
---

[Durandal][dr] is an open source web framework to help you build web, desktop and mobile apps. It's created by [Rob Eisenberg][rob] the excellent developer who created [Caliburn.Micro][cm] which I think shows it's pedigree well.

Right now they're running a [Kickstarter][ks] campaign to raise some funds to help build better training, releases, tooling and the next gen version.

I don't do much web development at the moment but the preview of the next gen version blew me away.

Check it out and help a great open source framework.
