It's been a long time coming but I'm really happy to say the Nokia developer reward program [DVLUP][dvlup] is now available in New Zealand. We at [Marker Metro][mm] have been working with Nokia to set up a launch here in Auckland. Come along to find out more about it and get a recap of the news and announcements from Build. [RSVP here][reg].

If you already want to sign up then use [this link][reg] and score me some bonus XP.
