Some of you may have noticed but I've rebuilt the website / blog. Previously it was sitting as a custom Asp.Net MVC app running on [Azure websites][azure] using SQL Azure as a back end.

In an effort to try new things this new website is using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub pages][pages]. While setting up the new website was a piece of cake most of the work went into preserving as many existing uri's as possible.

If I have missed any I'd love to hear about them.
