A few months ago I showed off [Spinkit.Xaml][github] a set of styles for Windows 8 Progress Ring to make your project look a little more interesting.

I've just pushed a new version to [Nuget][nuget] (1.1.0.0) that supports Windows Phone 8.1 which means you can use the styles in univeral projects.

Check it out and have a play, if you're uising it in a project then let me know.
