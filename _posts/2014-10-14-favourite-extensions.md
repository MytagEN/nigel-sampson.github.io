title: My Favourite Visual Studio Extensions

A week or so ago I came across a post from [Scott Dorman](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2014/10/05/favorite-visual-studio-extensions.aspx) on his favuorite Visual Studio extensions and thought I'd create mine.

Initially I thought it would be a rather long list, but it turns out the out of the box experience is pretty good for me with a few changes.

Here's my list (in no particular order).

### [Reference Extension SDK Locally](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1f027247-1e01-4ec6-8f5b-70dabb375217)

This was built by [Pete Goodman](http://www.petegoo.com/) while at [Marker Metro(http://www.markermetro.com/), it takes a global reference to a Visual Studio SDK and turns into a local reference.

It solves a number of problems:

 - Don't have a laundry list of SDK's to install to build the project for new developers.
 - Eases the pain on the build server not requiring SDK's to be installed.
 - Allows different projects to reference different versions of the SDK.

### [Nuget](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4ec1526c-4a8c-4a84-b702-b21a8f5293ca)

The go to package manage for .net, can't say much more than that.

### [Xaml Spy](http://xamlspy.com/learn/vsintegration)

Great tool for finding out why your xaml layouts aren't pixel perfect which I think is one of the things that makes good apps into great apps.

### [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)

This is the extension I can't live without, it's the one I install directly after Visual Studio and feel absolutely useless without it.
