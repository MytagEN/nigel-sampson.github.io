I'll be speaking in a few weeks at an in person seminar here in Auckland called [MVP CompCamp 2015][cc] on February the 10th . It's a good chance to meet and connect some of the NZ MVP's and learn some cool things on Azure and how it intersects with App development.

You can [register here][cc], look forward to seeing you.
