In a bit of surprise news (I wasn't expecting this till [Build][build]) but Microsoft have just announced the release of the 
[Windows 10 Technical Preview Tools][tools]. This will let us build and upgrade our apps to the Windows 10 Universal App
Platform.

To help you get started I'd recommend checking out the [sample apps][github] on GitHub, and the [Developer's Guide to 
Windows 10 Preview][c9] on Channel 9.

I'll start to post more of what I discover as I go through them.
