        <h3>Apps and Tutorials for Windows Phone</h3>
        <p>I've posted a collection of tutorials and example applications for Windows Phone, the first series is based on the "31 days of Apps" by the guys at apps amuck. I find it better by building real applications and their series was great inspiration. While these won't produce marketplace ready applications they're the first step on the way.</p>
